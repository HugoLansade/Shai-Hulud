# Shai Hulud - A project inspired from the Dune universe

## Introduction

This little game was inspired from Dune a Frank Herbert's book, recently re-adapte to screen by Denis Villeneuve.

## The Game

### Technologies
I developped the game with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The visual part of the game work with CanvasJS.
By developping this game I improved my skills in DOM manipulation, class manipulation and function optimization.

### Gameplay
To play the game you first have to open the book page by clicking on the right arrow. 
Then continue to the next page and finaly you'll reach the playing part of the project.

On the right you can find the screen you'll play with. Use arrows of your keyboard to slide under the sand. 
You embody Shai Hulud, the giant worm sand of Arakis. You have to move through to reach the upper part of the sand to eat your enemies :

* Harkonnens in black
* Sardaukars in white
* Harkonnen's vehicules in black and grey
* Spice factory in brown

You will win point of life by eating your enemies but loosing some when touching bombs : 

* Red : Harkonnen bombs (on the sand)
* Blue/White : Sardaukar bombs (on the sand)
* Azur/Red/Grey : Harkonnen's vehicule bombs (under the sand)

On the left you can find the level where you are currently (Chapter x).
But also a brief description of the battle you are leading and finaly a slider to jump to a chapter if you don't have time for the 100 levels...
